Serverless Dimensional Analytics on AWS

Overview

A serverless data pipeline designed for dimensional modeling and analytics using AWS services. It efficiently extracts, processes, and loads data into AWS Redshift, enabling powerful analytical queries.

Architecture

1. Data Extraction & Storage
Raw data is ingested and stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
AWS Glue Crawler scans and catalogs the data for metadata insights.
2. Data Processing & Transformation
A relational model is created to structure the data.
AWS Athena is used to query and validate extracted data.
Python-based transformations shape the dimensional model.
3. Data Loading & Analytics
The transformed data is loaded into AWS Redshift.
Queries and analytics are performed on the Redshift data warehouse.

Tech Stack

AWS Services: S3, Glue, Athena, Redshift

Programming Languages: Python (for data transformations)

Database & Querying: SQL, AWS Athena, Redshift

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
2. Configure AWS Credentials: Ensure you have AWS CLI installed and configured:
3. Deploy the Pipeline
Upload raw data to an S3 bucket.
Run AWS Glue Crawler to generate metadata.
Use Athena to validate and query the data.
Execute the Python script to transform the data.
Load the processed data into Redshift for analytics.

Usage

Run Athena SQL queries to validate data.
Use Python scripts to perform ETL operations.
Query Redshift for dimensional analysis and insights.

Future Enhancements

Automate the pipeline using AWS Step Functions.
Implement partitioning and indexing for query optimization.
Extend support for real-time streaming data ingestion.
